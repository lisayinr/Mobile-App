# Overview

I created this Flashcard App to develop my skills and understanding of mobile app development using React Native and Expo. My goal and purpose for creaating this app was to learn how to create simple but functionaal mobile applications and to gain experience with building interactive user interfaces.

This app lets users study flashcards from their mobile device. The app allows users to add new flashcards by entering aa question and an answer, and then view them by flipping through cards. Each card shows a question and then reveals the answer when the user selects to show the answer. To access the app on your mobile device, download the Expo Go app, run "npx expo start" on VSCode or on your computer's terminal, scan the QR code with your mobile device's camera and it will open the app.
